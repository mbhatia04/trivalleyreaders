      <h1>Membership</h1>
      <p class="lead">How to join Tri-Valley Readers and what to expect as a member.</p>

      <h2>Who Can Join</h2>
      <p>Anyone with a love of reading and an interest in thoughtful discussion is welcome. We're based in the Tri-Valley area and meet in person, so being able to attend local meetings is ideal. No prior book club experience required.</p>

      <h2>What Membership Includes</h2>
      <ul class="membership-list">
        <li><span class="icon">✒</span> <strong>Monthly discussions</strong> — A dedicated meeting each month to discuss the current book in a friendly, structured format.</li>
        <li><span class="icon">✒</span> <strong>Say in picks</strong> — Members suggest and vote on upcoming titles so the list reflects the group's interests.</li>
        <li><span class="icon">✒</span> <strong>Updates & reminders</strong> — Email or group chat reminders for meeting dates, location, and the next book so you never miss a discussion.</li>
        <li><span class="icon">✒</span> <strong>Social events</strong> — Occasional meetups beyond the monthly discussion (e.g., author talks, seasonal get-togethers) when we organize them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Expectations</h2>
      <p>We ask that members do their best to read the current book before each meeting so the discussion is meaningful for everyone. We understand life gets busy — if you can't finish in time, you're still welcome to attend and listen. We value respect, openness, and a spoiler-free environment until the group has discussed the book.</p>

      <h2>How to Join</h2>
      <p>Fill out the membership form below. Once you've been accepted, you'll receive an email with the next meeting details and member information. Your first meeting is a great way to see if the group is a good fit — no commitment required.</p>

        Welcome to Tri-Valley Readers! We are a women-only book club based in the Tri-Valley Region of the East Bay, but ladies from all corners of the Bay Area are welcome to join.
      </p>

      <p>
        We meet on a monthly basis and read everything including fantasy, feminist literature, gothic horror, historical romance, and beyond! We draw upon recommendations from our members and are always open to new suggestions.
      </p>

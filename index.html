        Welcome to Tri-Valley Readers — a community of book lovers in the Tri-Valley area who meet to share great reads, lively discussions, and the joy of reading.

        Whether you're into fiction, memoir, or the occasional thriller, you'll find a friendly group here. We meet regularly to talk about our current pick, swap recommendations, and sometimes even host author Q&As. New faces are always welcome.

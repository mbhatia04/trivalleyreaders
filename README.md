# Tri-Valley Readers — Book Club Website

A simple, multi-page website for the Tri-Valley Readers book club.

## Pages

- **Home** (`index.html`) — Welcome, tagline, and overview of what the club does
- **Reading List** (`reading-list.html`) — Tabs for "Currently Reading" and "Past Reads" with sample books
- **Membership** (`membership.html`) — Who can join, what’s included, expectations, and contact info

## How to view

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with → your browser). No server or build step required.

To edit:

- **Content:** Change the text in each `.html` file.
- **Styling:** Edit `styles.css` (colors, fonts, and layout are in variables at the top).
- **Books:** Update the book entries in `reading-list.html` and replace the placeholder contact email in `membership.html`.

## Tech

Plain HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript for the reading-list tabs. No frameworks or dependencies.
